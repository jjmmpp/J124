Create a table of 3 jobs/internships you have had (you can include more if you want to). The left column should be the place of employment; label the header “Employer.” The right column should be a few lines about what you did; label the column header “Job Description.”  Write 2-3 things you did in the right column for each job as an unordered list with bullet points.
